What is ReplixOS?
ReplixOS is an operating system developed by Russian programmers and coders to show people how the design
can change workspace environment and add to desktop some beautiful widgets, apps, and more things that you
can customize all over your screen. Actually it doesnt have core, like Linux or Unix. It is developed by
own-created language named "Redivend". 5 years have gone and today it named "XRadix".
